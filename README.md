# botty

A simple library for writing irc bots, based on ircjl and some core.async glue

If you want something more powerful consider lazybot - I wrote this as I couldn't use lazybot easily (no mongodb on servers, wanted to run via uberjar) and I just wanted some simple bots.

## Usage

See also [http://github.com/kornysietsma/hodor] for a simple bot using this

You can run this bot with the right defaults - it will just print "tick" a lot, and let you quit.
